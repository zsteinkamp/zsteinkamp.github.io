I was playing with a big toy magnifying glass with my daughters one day, and thought, "hmm, I wonder if I can use this with a camera".  Sure enough, it worked, but the big plastic lens in the toy had quality issues.  With a better lens, this could be a really interesting thing!

So I did a bit of googling and found the site <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/">Optics Planet</a>.  They have many different magnifiers, from <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/konus-4x-quicklens-magnifiers-3239.html">very cheap models</a> to <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/zeiss-optics-3x-6x-aplanatic-achromatic-pocket-magnifier-d36.html">"Whoa! That's pricey!" items from Carl Zeiss</a>.

I settled on the next tier down from Zeiss, which is a range from Bausch and Lomb called <a href="http://images1.opticsplanet.com/365-240-ffffff/opplanet-bausch-lomb-triplet-magnifiers-3-1.jpg">Hastings Triplet Loupes</a>.  They are a three element design, and had good quality reviews.  I also liked how it had a metal body with a loop for a lanyard or other tether.  I chose the 10x model, and placed my order.

It showed up this past Friday and exceeded my expectations for quality.  I took this photo of a dime to check it out...

Whoa!

Here's how it looks to use it with the phone...

So I went for a hike that evening and brought the magnifier with me.  Got some neat pictures of plants and animals...

Go forth and capture the tiny world around us.  It's easy!
