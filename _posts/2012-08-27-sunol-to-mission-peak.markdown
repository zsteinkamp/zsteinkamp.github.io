I took my new favorite shoes out this morning (New Balance MT1010) for a run/hike in Sunol today.  I had a time limit, since we were all meeting up at Kanta's house for lunch and a family celebration.  I managed to get from Sunol to Mission Peak and back (12 miles) in just over 2.5 hours.  It felt like I was mostly running, but looking back at the GPS data it was maybe 1/2 the time.  

Regardless, this was the most enjoyable running time I've ever had.  This could be the start of something new...
