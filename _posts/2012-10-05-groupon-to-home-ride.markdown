I decided to ride my bike home from work today.  Ended up taking about 2.5 hours, and covered 27 miles, most of it on the Bay Trail and Guadalupe River Trail.

Next time I'll probably knock 30 minutes off since I'll do less backtracking.  It wasn't a simple point-A to point-B kind of ride -- there are a few tricky parts where the trail will dead-end or go to an undercrossing filled with water.  But I managed to get home before dark!
