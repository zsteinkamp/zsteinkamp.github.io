Our friends Deanna and Nathan and their dogs compete in dog agility contests.  We drove down to Prunedale today to see them do their stuff.  They're getting ready to go to nationals this year in Denver.  There were some impressive dogs and handlers there today!

Here is Deanna and Quinn:

Deanna and Quinn doing the "Standard" course -- 20 obstacles that must be done in a particular order.  There are a few different types of courses, each with their own rules, and they are never the same.
