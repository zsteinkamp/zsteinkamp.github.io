At long last ... the TV stand is finished, installed,
and operational.

we were waiting until we got our new furniture to make
sure the stain/finish on the tv stand matched.  

i put the final coat of polyurethane on last night
(note to self: using a brush is for suckers ... dilute
50/50 with mineral spirits and wipe on several thin
coats next time).  it was dry this AM, so we hauled it
in from the garage and i put all the stuff in/on it.
