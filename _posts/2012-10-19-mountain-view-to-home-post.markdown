I'm lucky to live and work near such a great network of trails.  Of the 22 miles covered, I was on the road with cars for maybe 2.  From downtown Mountain View, it's maybe 1/2 mile down Evelyn to the Stevens Creek Trail.  Cross Central Expwy on the ped bridge, continue north to the bay, turn East at the Bay Trail, then turn south at the Guadalupe River Trail.

Saw this crazy contraption in the bog near Moffet:

There was a serious headwind the whole way.  I was working hard to maintain 10mph.  Normally I'll cruise at 14 on the gravel and asphalt trails with a nice tailwind.  It was dry and hot, so the 22 miles felt more like 30 ;-) It took a bit more than 2 hours.
