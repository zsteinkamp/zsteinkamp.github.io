Second time riding home today.  It took 30 minutes less today, despite taking a bit longer route.  This is mostly due to not taking wrong turns and having to backtrack ;-).

This is the pedestrian bridge over 101 near Oregon Expressway:

Ominous clouds over Moffett and Black Mountain.

The light was really cool while I was out by the bay.  The sky was mostly dark, but there were patches where the sun was shining through.

There were a bunch of white pelicans swimming together and having a feast in the sloughs.

Despite not being terribly strenuous, I'm beat after 2 hours in the saddle.  It's a great time though!
