    excerpt: I hit the trail at 8am today in Ed Levin County Park.  It was a beautiful,
      cool, sunny morning ... mid-50s.  It was an ideal day out there today -- warm
      sun and cool breeze.  I covered 16 miles, 4200 ft elevation gain, in 3h40m.

I hit the trail at 8am today in Ed Levin County Park.  It was a beautiful, cool, sunny morning ... mid-50s.  The plan was to take the Calera Creek Trail to the Agua Caliente Trail, along the Bay Area Ridge Trail, then up and over Mission Peak, and back behind the peak.  I added a bit extra after the Peak to get a bit more distance.

It was an ideal day out there today -- warm sun and cool breeze.  I covered 16 miles, 4200 ft elevation gain, in 3h40m.

Today was the first time out where I was happy running uphill.  Prior to today I would get really tired after just a bit of uphill work.  Today I made a point to push through that fatigue, and managed to run all the way from Monument Peak, behind Mt. Allison, and up the south side of Mission Peak, down the north side, and back without walking.  Stopping every few miles for a minute to stretch my knees/quads helped too.

On the way down I passed a feisty little rattlesnake.  It was much more aggressive than any adult rattler I'd passed before -- it's like it wanted to eat me!

Arti had the genius idea to pack a little cooler with ice-cold treats for the end of the hike: a can of soda water, a super delicious pear, and a huge chunk of watermelon.  I found a shady spot near the car and enjoyed the cool goodness!

I did another cold soak once I got home, which really helps my feet and legs recover.  They're tired, but I don't feel crippled like I have in the past!
